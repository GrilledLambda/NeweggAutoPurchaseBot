# Newegg Auto Purchase Bot

This is a auto-purchase bot that uses selenium and HTTP requests to check for available products on NewEgg. All the settings you need to configure will be in BotSettings.py Check the requirements folder for dependencies.
# 
Once you are done configuring the settings in BotSettings.py, open an elevated CMD, navigate to the Requirements folder directory, and run the following command to automatically install dependencies:  
```
<i style="color: blue;"> pip3 -r requirements.txt </i>
```
#
After that you are good to go. 
Just run ScanPages.py
#
Please report any bugs you find.  
```diff
- run at your own risk. I am unsure if this violates Newegg's terms
```
